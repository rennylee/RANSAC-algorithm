# RANSAC-algorithm
In this comprehensive assignment, you will implement an algorithm that will detect the dominant planes
in a cloud of 3D points. The dominant plane of a set of 3D points is the plane that contains the largest
number of points. A 3D point is contained in a plane if it is located at a distance less than eps (Îµ) from
that plane. To detect these planes, you will use the RANSAC algorithm.
